# Minecraft-GB
This is the repository for the Minecraft: Gameboy Edition. This edition can run a 2D Minecraft clone that's been made with the completely free application GB Studio! Currently, there are only a few settings, a main menu and randomly generated worlds where you can play it. If you've a gameboy, you can try it out if you want! Have fun playing with the Minecraft: Gameboy Edition!
NOTES:
* This isn't an official Minecraft Edition, it's only a fan made Minecraft-Edition!
* Multiplayer is currently not supported and will never be due to platform limitations!
* This app can only run on very, very old Nintendo Gameboys.! Other devices are currently NOT supported with the Gameboy Edition of Minecraft!
* This is only a 2D Minecraft: PE clone and 3D will never be because all these Nintendo Gameboys can't currently support 3D and they'll never be!
