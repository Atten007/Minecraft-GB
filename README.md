# Minecraft-GB
This is the repository for the Minecraft: Gameboy Edition. This edition can run a 2D Minecraft clone that's been made with the completely free application GB Studio! Currently, there are only a few settings, a main menu and randomly generated worlds where you can play it. If you've a gameboy, you can try it out if you want! Have fun playing with the Minecraft: Gameboy Edition!
